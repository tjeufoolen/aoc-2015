# Day 1: Not Quite Lisp - Part Two

Now, given the same instructions, find the _position_ of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor `-1`). The first character in the instructions has position `1`, the second character has position `2`, and so on.

For example:

- `)` causes him to enter the basement at character position `1`.
- `()())` causes him to enter the basement at character position `5`.

_What is the *position* of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?_
